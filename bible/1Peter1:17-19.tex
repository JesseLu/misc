Peter is saying, ``if $A$ is true, then you must do $B$''.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In this verse, who is being judged, Christians or unbelievers? 
    How do we know this?
\item This verse says that God's judgement is ``according to each man's work'',
    what is meant by one's ``work''?
\item Since God judges ``without partiality'', 
    how does God's standard of judgement vary from one person to the other, 
    if at all?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In what way is the life was the life we were redeemed from 
    aimless and futile?
