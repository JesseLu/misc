\section*{Notes}
\I  The point of this sermon is:
        \begin{quote} 
        You need to know and obey the Revelation of Jesus Christ.
        \end{quote}

This Scripture prepares us to read and obey the rest of the book.
It does so by telling us what Revelation is about
    and what we must do with it.
    
In this light, the goal of this sermon is to place a burden on the hearers 
    to know and become familiar with the contents of this book, 
    and to heed the commands given in it.

\I Rev 5:9 \Q{``You are worthy to take the scroll, \\
                And to open its seals; \\

                will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters.
                And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.''}
\I Rev 21:22-23 \Q{But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty 
                and the Lamb are its temple. The city had no need 
                of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, 
                for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.}

                clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God 
                and of the Lamb. In the middle of its street, and on either
                of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits,
                each tree yielding its fruit every month. 
                The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.}
\I Rev 22:3-4 \Q{And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God
                and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall 
                serve Him. They shall see His face, and His name shall be on
                their foreheads.}
