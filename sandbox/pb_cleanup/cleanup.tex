\section{What is this?}
A simple plan to be faithful to maintain the property that God has given us.
Pairs of members are assigned a specific month in which
    to clean the main church building.
Cleanings should occur \textbf{the week leading up to or following the 4th Sunday} 
    of the given month 
    (in order to be best spaced from the work day cleaning).
Pairs are assigned so that this time can also be used as a time of fellowship.
