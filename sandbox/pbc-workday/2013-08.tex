\I  Annex carpet estimate 
    \BI We haven't committed to carpeting the Annex, 
        but it would be really beneficial to have a cost/work/style estimate.
    \I  If unexperienced with carpeting rooms, you may want to consult someone
        who does or the internet first.
    \I  Determine amount of carpeting needed to cover annex dining room.
    \I  Visit Lowe's (811 E Arques Ave) and choose around 3 carpet samples.
    \I  Also, obtain cost estimates for each of the samples.
    \I  Hopefully we can plan on a carpet to install next month. \EI
\I  General restocking of needed items
\I  Re-organize the janitor closet
    \BI Feel free to throw away what does not appear useful
        (e.g. bottles with only a little solution remaining). \EI

    \BI Diameter of pipes (flashings) and approximate degree of roof 
        need to first be measured in order to purchase the correct rubber boots.
    \I  Rubber boots then need to be installed. \EI
