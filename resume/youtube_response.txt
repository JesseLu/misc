1) Location preference:
Mountain View: I'd love to be able to interact with the largest breadth of Google engineers. However, any location in the Bay Area is okay with me as well.

2) Technical areas of expertise:
GPU programming: accelerated codes by factors of 10x-30x using CUDA. 
Optimization / Machine learning / Numerical linear algebra: with emphasis on convex optimization.
Distributed systems: from building my own simulation-as-a-service in the cloud.
Electromagnetic simulation and optimization: may not be relevant to Youtube, but was my Phd thesis.

3) Areas of interest within Youtube:

4) Programming languages:
Matlab
Python
CUDA (for Nvidia GPUs)
C
Java

5) Time constraints:
I would like to start working before the end of the 2013 year at the latest.

6) Availability to start:
July 1st.

7) References within Google:
Conley Owens
Addison Luh
(I can probably think of others if needed)

Hi Jesse,

Hello from YouTube and hope this email finds you well!
Thank you for your prior interest in Google and speaking with us before.
You were referred to our staffing team by a fellow Googler and I'd
love to connect with you regarding software engineering opportunities.
I'm a Recruiter with YouTube/Google's engineering staffing team and
focus on YouTube's search for exceptional talent.

As an overview, YouTube develops the next-generation technologies
which have changed how millions interact, making accessible and useful
the world's information.
Our ambitions reach far beyond just search to handle information at
the the scale of the web requires ideas from every areas of computer
science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence,
natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system
design, networking, security, data compression and user interface
design; the list goes on and is growing every day.

Here are some great links about YouTube to check out:

Let's set up a time to connect on the phone.  As I would love to get a
better understanding of your background and career interests.  Please
let me know some convenient times and dates over the next week or so,
to reach you and we'll confirm a time.  You should plan on about 20-30
minutes. **Please also provide me the best number for you to be
reached at for our phone chat.

Additionally, in order to streamline the process, it would be great if
you could provide answers to the following questions. This way we'll
have a great foundation for our conversation going forward.

1) What is your location preference?

2) What are your technical areas of expertise (eg. Distributed
systems, Web applications & multi-tiered systems, Advanced Algorithms,
Machine learning, etc...)?

3) Which areas are you interested in working in at YouTube? Are you
open to working in other new/interesting areas? (please be brief)

4) What are your strongest programming languages (in order of strength)?

5) Do you have any time constraints (offers expected, vacations planned, etc.)?

6) When would you be available to start a new position?

7) Are there people at Google who know you professionally or
personally (such as from school) that might be able to provide a
reference?

I look forward to speaking with you soon Prerit!

best regards, :Marlene
