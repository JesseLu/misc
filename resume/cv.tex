\section{PhD Research: Nanophotonic computational design}
Developed software to 
    design arbitrary linear nanophotonic devices which 
    are fully three-dimensional and multi-modal,
    exhibit novel functionality,
    have very compact footprints,
    exhibit high efficiency, 
    are strongly robust to fluctuations in 
    wavelength, temperature and fabrication error, and
    are manufacturable.
Critically, the developed software 
    does not require the user to be a nanophotonic expert or 
    to perform any manual tuning. 
Instead, devices are designed
    solely based on the user's desired performance specification for the device.

    Existing nanophotonic design process consisted of trial-and-error
        where each simulation about 24 hours to complete.
    Implemented FDTD and FDFD simulation software on hardware-accelerated platforms 
    to bring simulation times down to 10 minutes.
    Also developed a novel ``objective-first'' nanophotonic design algorithm
        and demonstrated automated design of arbitrary linear nanophotonic 
        devices.

    Surface plasmon focusing device required a grating coupler to inject energy
        into the surface plasmon mode.
    Wrote a Matlab program interfacing with a FEM package (COMSOL),
        developed a hierarchal optimization routine as well as an extended 
        transfer matrix model to produce first-ever thoroughly optimized 
        grating coupler design.
